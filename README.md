# Data Structures in C

---

This repository contains C implementations of fundamental data structures. Each data structure is organized into its own dedicated folder, providing clear and concise examples for learning and reference.

## Implemented Data Structures

Here's a list of the data structures currently implemented in this repository:

* **Static Arrays:** Basic array implementations with a fixed size.
* **Dynamic Arrays:** Arrays that can grow or shrink in size during runtime.
* **Linked Lists:** Various forms of linked lists (singly, doubly, circular – specify if you have different types!)
* **Stacks:** LIFO (Last-In, First-Out) data structure implementations.
* **Hashes (Hash Tables):** Implementations of hash tables for efficient key-value storage.
* **Heaps:** Binary heap implementations (min-heap, max-heap – specify if you have both or just one!).

## How to Use

Each data structure's implementation is located in its respective folder. To compile and run an example:

1.  Navigate to the specific data structure's folder (e.g., `cd linkedlist`).
2.  Compile the C source files using a C compiler like GCC:
    ```bash
    gcc -o <executable_name> <source_file(s)_name>.c
    ```
    (Replace `<executable_name>` and `<source_file_name>.c` with the actual names, e.g., `gcc -o linkedlist_test main.c linkedlist.c`)
3.  Run the executable:
    ```bash
    ./<executable_name>
    ```
